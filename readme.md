# Description

A progressive web app made with React and WordPress backend for a uni project. The main goal is to create a virtual bookshelf where people can see which books their friends own to prevent buying the same books within a group of friends.

## Important notes

- "add to bookshelf" functionality was implemented in a rush and there was no time left; so a reload is necessary in order to show effect :-)
- in order to activate notifications, you have to click the notification bell in the header (https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2019/11/04/restricting-notification-permission-prompts-in-firefox/)
- notifications are not working in chrome, i couldn't find out why
- page reloads after login -> temporary fix for a problem connected to React Context API

## Features yet to be implemented

- pretty design
- add book to my bookshelf
- add friends
- request borrowing a book from a friend
- search

- reset lost password
